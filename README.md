# Blockchain_Solution_Power_Sector_India
This proposal aims to outline a blockchain solution to address crucial issues, bringing transparency, efficiency, and democratization to India’s Electric Power sector.

Main Ideas:
1. Supply Chain Optimization: Leverage blockchain’s inherent transparency and
traceability to find and address faults and bottlenecks in the energy supply chain. By
recording every transaction on a tamper-proof ledger, we can have a real-time view of
the entire supply chain and make necessary adjustments.

2. Decentralized Energy Trading: Establish a peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading
platform using blockchain technology. Households and small-scale producers can tokenize their surplus energy and trade it directly with other consumers or exchanges.
This tokenization will create a new energy credit system that democratizes energy
distribution.

3. Consumption Analytics: Use blockchain’s data storage capabilities to record and
analyze daily energy consumption. This data will be invaluable for grid optimization, infrastructure upgrades, and for providing incentives to communities that adopt
sustainable practices.

## Features 
The Energy Dapp provides the following features:
- Dashboard: Displays various metrics related to energy production, consumption, transactions, and participants.
- Supply Chain: Visualizes the supply chain of energy production and consumption through a diagram and table.
- Energy Market: Facilitates trading of energy tokens, displaying the current token price, and transaction history.
- Consumption Analytics: Shows analytics and trends of energy consumption over different time periods.
- Nodes: Allows managing nodes with power units and ether balances.
